# TV-Script-Generation-using-RNN
Project Number -3 from Deep Learning Nanodegree


In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

We have used Embedding Layers,LSTM Layers and Dense Layers to create the RNN.
